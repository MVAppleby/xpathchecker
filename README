Instructions:

To build the plugin, just run 'ant' to create build/xpathchecker.xpi.

To run the unit tests, you will need to download and install jsunit (not
included) and open 'test/test.html' from within jsunit.

The xpathchecker.ipr and xpathchecker.iml are configuration files for
IntelliJ IDEA.

The build.xml file contains other targets for automatically installing
the plugin in firefox, but they will need modification for anyone else
to use them.

Plans:

I don't plan on making any changes other than to make sure that XPath
Checker works with new versions of Firefox.  However, I'll be happy to
review any patches that you want to send my way.  (It may take a while.)

Ideas:

None of this will happen unless someone volunteers to do it.

- improve XPath Checker's automatically generated expressions to use
things like CSS classes.  (There should probably be a way to rotate
between different possibilities since no single way is best for all
websites.)

- keep a history of recent xpath expressions and do autocompletion.
Ideally this will be context-sensitive, so only the xpath expressions
that could possibly work will show up.

- add a way to save your favorite xpath expressions in something
like bookmarks

- add a way to upload your favorite expressions to a server and
download other people's xpath expresions

- unit testing: if you could save xpath expressions, target URL's,
and expected results, XPath Checker could be used as a simple test
suite for a website.  (This was actually my original goal for XPath
Checker before discovering something more fun.)
